  <h2>Itemized Breakdown</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose. One of the files should
      be named index.html. Your pages must link to each other in a logical and meaningful flow.
      <p>There are five distinct pages with a clear navigation bar on top.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Each page must declare its favicon (fine and possibly preferred to use the same one for all pages).
      <p>Done.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Your site must include some sort of header.
      <p>Present at the top of all pages.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Your site must include some sort of navigation links.
      <p>A navigation bar/buttons are present on the top of the website.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries. Use comments to note
      where you completed this activity. You may do this in a variety of ways. Consider using this to control images or
      switching blocks between rows (for large screens) and columns (for small).
      <p>Each site has two distinctive layouts.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Your site must include images, and their alt attributes must adequately describe the image content to users of
      screen readers, users with images disabled, and webcrawlers.
      <p>All images have either alt text OR captions directly below the image which describe them. This approach was
        advised by WebAIM.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the Nu Validator Links
      to an external site. and WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluator Links to an external site..
      <p>Done.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are often rendered in a sans-serif font, and
      paragraph copy in a serif font.
      <p>Headings are in sans-serif, paragraphs in default serif.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>Your site must include at least one form. The form need not do anything at this point in your learning, but it
      must be present and it must use built-in content verification. Like all content, it must be neatly aligned.
      <p>Form is present on page “Volunteer”</p>
    </li>
    <li>Your site must include links to external sites.
      <p>A link to jmu.edu is present in the “hours” page.</p>
    </li>
