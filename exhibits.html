              The Duke Dog Statue is perhaps the most famous exhibit here at JMuseum.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the Great Storm of 2028, so much rain was dumped on the Statue
              that it rusted completely. Taken out of commission due to its lack
              of structural soundness, the Duke Dog Statue was scheduled for the scrap heap
              until JMuseum rescued and restored it.
            </p>
            <p>
              It now sits in front of our home in Wilson Hall, available for all to enjoy!

              The Scroll of Charter is our own secret slice of history!
            </p>
            <p>
              While Madison College was first founded in the early 20th century, its roots trace far further back.
              After Thomas Jefferson founded UVA in 1819, James Madison, tired of Jefferson's constant boasting,
              vowed to create his own university to rival Jefferson's.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alas, James Madison died too early to see his vision executed. But his draft Scroll of Charter,
              in which he eloquently explains to readers the need for a new university, remains in our possession today!
