      <div class="article">
        <p>Way back in 2025, a group of JMU students
          met at D-Hall for some lunch. While enjoying casual lunchtime conversation,
          one remarked about just how many important artifacts of JMU history were languishing
          unprotected on campus.
        </p>
        <p>Soon, the entire group was awash with tales of birds pooping on statues,
          squirrels chewing up old tomes, and teenaged delinquints vandalizing priceless relics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something had to be done!
        </p>
        <p>
          These young go-getters, not ones to let injustice slide, quickly organized a grassroots lobbying
          campaign, eventually convincing President Alger to give them a space in the basement of
          Carrier Library and a few minor tchotskys to hold.
        </p>
        <p>
          From these humble beginnings, JMuseum soon grew into the campus institution it is today, and eventually
          moved to its new home in Wilson Hall, where it currently resides on the second floor.

      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <div class="article">
        <p>At JMuseum, our passion is preservation!
          We want to ensure that all the great relics of JMU's illustrious history
          are available for future generations to enjoy.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we want to ensure that every JMU student knows just how
          complex and nuanced JMU history is. That's why we need more tour guides to share
          the wealth of knowledge with the masses.
